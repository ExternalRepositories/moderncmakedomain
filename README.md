# Sphinx Domain for Modern CMake

This is taken directly from the Kitware git repository's Utilities directory.
The original [sphinxcontrib-cmakedomain] has not been touched in quite some and
as a result it wildly out of date. Documenting CMake domain entities in
projects is painful otherwise.

This repository is under the same License as all of CMake, which is the
BSD-3-Clause license.

I will do my best to keep this module in sync with the one that Kitware uses
themselves.
